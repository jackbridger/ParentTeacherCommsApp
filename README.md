# README

This was an app built using Ruby on Rails, deployed on Heroku that allowed teachers to communicate more freely with parents on the progress of thieir child. 

This was based on some primary research that teachers biggest challenge is lack of time but equally there can be huge value from better communication with parents. 

Especially since most feedback is provided once or twice a year at parents evening.

The use case would be uploading grades en masse, adding a comment when a child is behaving out of the ordinary or the teacher has any particular concerns with the child's progress in certain areas. 

Equally and more importantly, if the child is doing well, the teacher can communicate this to the parents.

This was designed to be more streamlined than email which is necessarily formal and two way. This app is mostly designed to update parents rather than to enter into a time-consuming discussion with parents.
